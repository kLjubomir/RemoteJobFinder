## Software behaviour:

## Chronological Behaviour Driven Development Steps mapped to user stories  
When possible, use API to reduce the time complexity of operations

&nbsp;
- [ ] As a remote job filtering software, I want to have a login function so that I can log in to job seeking platforms that require it  

**Scenario: Login to LinkedIn**  
  **Given** job seeking platform requires login to query ads  
  **When** login to LinkedIn completed  
  **Then** home page is displayed  

&nbsp;
- [ ] As a remote job filtering software, I want to navigate to the page that lets me search for jobs so that I can search for jobs  

**Scenario: Access search in LinkedIn**  
  **Given** logged in to LinkedIn  
  **When** navigated to /jobs/  
  **Then** job searching functionality is displayed  

**Scenario: Access search in Indeed**  
  **Given** navigated to Indeed  
  **Then** job search displayed  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a filtering tool so that I can filter out non-English ads on LinkedIn  

**Scenario: Disregard non-English adverts**  
  **Given** advert description is fetched  
  **When** random words from advert description are taken  
  **Then** 80% of those words should be detected as English using the Compact Language Detector (CLD2) library from Google.  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a filtering tool so that I can filter out "on-site" adverts from my remote job search  

**Scenario: Disregard false remote adverts**  
  **Given** advert description is fetched  
  **When** description text includes words like "on-site", "onsite", "U.S. Citizen," etc.  
  **Then** the adverts are not truly remote adverts.  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a filtering tool so that I can filter ads that only include a keyword  

**Scenario: Include only jobs with keyword in description**  
  **Given** advert description is fetched  
  **When** description text includes an end-user described inclusion keyword  
  **Then** the adverts are filtered as matching  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a filtering tool so that I can filter ads that exclude a keyword  

**Scenario: Exclude jobs with keyword in description**  
  **Given** advert description is fetched  
  **When** description text includes an end-user described exclusion keyword  
  **Then** the adverts are filtered as non-matching  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a file generated for ads that have a salary range included  

**Scenario: Store advert URL in advertHasSalaryRange.json**  
  **Given** advert description from LinkedIn is fetched  
  **When** the filters set by the end-user all return true  
  **And** description text includes keywords indicating salary disclosure  
  **Then** the advert URLs are stored in advertHasSalaryRange.json  

_salary indicator: words like "per hour," "/h," "â‚¬," "$," "eur," "dollar," "annual," "a number between 5 digits separated by dot or comma (utils)," "number between 6 digits separated by dot or comma (utils)"_  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job seeker, I want to have a file generated for ads that don't include a salary range  

**Scenario: Store advert URL in advertWithoutSalaryRange.json**  
  **Given** advert description from LinkedIn is fetched  
  **When** the filters set by the end-user all return true  
  **And** description text doesn't include keywords indicating salary disclosure  
  **Then** the advert URLs are stored in advertWithoutSalaryRange.json  

&nbsp;  
- [ ] As a remote job filtering software, I want to have CLI-defined parameters so that I can dynamically adjust the filters: job title, description including, description excluding  

Use dotenv .env with defaults that would be overwritten when starting the suite over CLI process.env.jobTitle, process.env.descIncludes, process.env.descExcludes, null skip.
